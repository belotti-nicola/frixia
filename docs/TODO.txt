ISSUE:
    fifo seems controversial (EPOLLET only)

FEAT:
    HTTPS (integrabile)
    dispatchers
    python integration
    reentrancy check (multiple threads)
    logger

FIX:
    if start fails, remove it from fd pool
    search udp/fifo/tcp unique function
    
TODO
    parser (UDP/TCP) 
    icon
    create library
    ctl commands can be injected by any supported fd

CHOICES
    C vs C++
