TODO
    test add / remove frixia fds -> refactor this
    POC_FUN //TODO MARKED
    frixia_zombie -> ctrl termination / kill -9
    fifo error codes missing
    logger
    signal handling
    
ISSUE:
    fifo seems controversial (EPOLLET only)
    const char for fifo
    CMake and parent directory
    frixia_zombie that remain binded to <ADDRESS>:<PORT>

FEAT:
    reentrancy check (multiple threads)
    logger

FIX:
    if start fails, remove it from fd pool
    search udp/fifo/tcp unique function
    
REFACTORING
    enum UPPERCASES
    name ENGINE_EVENT / PROGRAM_EVENT (1.ENUM 2.START_<t>_EVENT)
    STOPALL: no need to call functions? check
    frixia_fd can be designed better 
    Q -> Q + mutex = SHARED_Q
    thread pool -> many Q to inject in threads Qs (dispatcher that delivers LOCAL DATA!)
    thread pool termination is by killing 

CHOICES
    C vs C++

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
    icon
    python integration
    HTTPS (integrabile)
    create library
